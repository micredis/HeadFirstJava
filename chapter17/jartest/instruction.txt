By using the -d flag, you get to decide which directory the compile code lands in,
rather than accepting the default of class files landing in the same directrory
as the source code. To compile all .java files in the source directory, use:

%javac -d ../classes *.java


Making an executable JAR

1
Make sure all of your class files are in
the classes directory


2
Create a manifest.txt file that states
which class has the main() method

Make a text file named manifest.txt that has a one line:

Main-Class: MyApp
(don’t put the .class on the end).

Press the return key after typing the Main-Class line, or your manifest may not work
correctly. Put the manifest file into the “classes” directory.


3
Run the jar tool to create a JAR file
that contains everything in the classes
directory, plus the manifest.

%cd MiniProject/classes
%jar -cvmf manifest.txt app1.jar *.class
OR
%jar -cvmf manifest.txt app1.jar MyApp.class



Running (executing) the JAR

%cd MyProject/classes

%java -jar app1.jar
